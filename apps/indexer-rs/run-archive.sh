# SPINE: genesis→7M backfill against the FREE opentensor public archive.
# No daily quota → this source NEVER stalls, so there is always forward progress
# regardless of what the OnFinality booster (run-onf.sh) is doing. Resumes from
# progress.archive.json. The supervisor loop relaunches on any crash/exit; the
# client's request_timeout prevents silent hangs. caffeinate blocks idle sleep
# (NOT lid-close — keep the lid open / on AC for a long run).
#
# BACKFILL_CONCURRENCY=1: this single process has no sharding, and subxt
# deadlocks a single client's per-block metadata fetch above conc=1 (verified
# in entrypoint.sh; independently reconfirmed in metagraphed-infra's
# indexer-rust role, which found even conc=4 against a real archive RPC stalls
# every shard). This script ran at conc=12, squarely in the deadlock range.
